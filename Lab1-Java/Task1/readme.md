# Socks Matching System

There is a heap of new labelled socks. Each sock is having one of four colors: white, black, blue and grey . There are several robotic arms which can pick up a single sock at a time and pass it to a matching machine . The matching machine is able to find two socks of the same color and pass the pair of socks to a shelf manager robot . The shelf manager robot then puts the pair of socks to the appropriate shelf.

## Usage

The JAVA file can be run from terminal/command prompt similar to other .java files.

The following command can be used in case of Linux OS, in the folder storing the .java files.

```bash
javac *.java
java SockMathing
```
The code is well-commented, making the code easy to understand and use. The input/output files are present in the **Files** directory.
